### Contributing
- Please contribute to make this list really awesome, exhaustive, and help us to keep it up to date.
- Contributing to this list is simple: the preferred approach is raising a pull request to this repo or at least opening up an issue. Reach out to me directly when in doubt or hitting any challenges.
- Please provide details as required by that section.  Links, author names, date published, which certification(s) does it apply to, etc.
- For book links, try to use localization agnostic links. When in doubt, please commit your link, and it will be exchanged if necessary.
- Share! Share this link and share your knowledge. I will be happy to add a reference to your future articles to the list as well.

### Adding to this list
